Jovani et al’s study contributes important evidence linking childhood trauma (CT) and parental socialization with at-risk mental state (ARMS) in non-clinical adolescents, demonstrating the mediating role of low levels of parental affection
and communication in this relationship. This letter commends the study’s strengths while also identifying key issues that warrant further attention, including the limitations of cross-sectional design, potential perceptual biases, conceptual
overlap between CT and parenting, and limited cultural generalizability. We advocate for longitudinal, culturally sensitive, and multi-informant approaches to further refine ARMS risk models, strengthen theoretical distinctions between CT
and parenting, and inform targeted prevention strategies across diverse populations. We also extend the discussion by highlighting promising directions for future research.
