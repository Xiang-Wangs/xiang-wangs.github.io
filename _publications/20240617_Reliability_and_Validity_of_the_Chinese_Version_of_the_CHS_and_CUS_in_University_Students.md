Abstract
------
<strong>Objective</strong>: To test the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Childhood Harshness (Perceived Resource Scarcity) Scale (CHS) and the Chinese version of the Childhood Unpredictability Scale (CUS) for Chinese university students. 
<strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 1056 university students were enrolled from two university in Hunan province, China. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Subjective Socioeconomic Status (SSS), General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) were used for testing convergent validity and incremental validity, respectively. After two weeks, a total of 311 participants were enrolled for retesting. 
<strong>Results</strong>: Exploratory factor analysis showed a two-factor structure for CHS and a single factor structure for CUS. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that CHS and CUS had good fitting indexes. CHS was significantly negatively correlated with SSS, and CUS was significantly positively correlated with CTQ, indicating good convergent validity for two scales. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that CHS and CUS explained additional variance in GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PCL-5 after controlling for the influence of CTQ, indicating that both CHS and CUS have good incremental validity. The internal consistency coefficients of CHS and CUS were 0.881 and 0.936, respectively. The test-retest reliability of CHS and CUS were 0.862 and 0.919, respectively. 
<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The Chinese version of the CHS and CUS demonstrated good reliability and validity among Chinese university students and could be used as effective instruments to assess childhood harshness and unpredictability.

<strong>目的</strong>：检验中文版童年期严酷性量表（childhood harshness scale, CHS）和童年期不可预测性量表（childhood unpredictability scale, CUS）在大学生中的信效度。
<strong>方法</strong>：使用中文版CHS和CUS在湖南省两所高校1056名大学生中施测，使用儿童期创伤问卷（CTQ）、主观社会经济地位量表（SSS）、广泛性焦虑问卷（GAD-7）、病人健康问卷抑郁症状群量表（PHQ-9）及创伤后应激症状量表（PCL-5）分别检验聚合效度和增值效度。2周后选取311名被试进行重测。
<strong>结果</strong>：探索性因素分析提示CHS为二因子结构，CUS为单因子结构；；验证性因素分析表明CHS和CUS拟合指数良好。CHS与SSS显著负相关，CUS与CTQ显著正相关。分层多元回归分析结果显示在控制CTQ的影响后，CHS和CUS解释了焦虑、抑郁以及创伤后应激症状的额外变异，表明CHS和CUS均具有良好的增值效度。CHS和CUS的内部一致性系数分别为0.881和0.936，重测信度分别为0.862和0.919。
<strong>结论</strong>：中文版CHS和CUS在我国大学生中具有良好的信效度，可以作为测量童年期严酷性和不可预测性的有效工具。
