Thanks for visiting my page!

I am a research fellow at Faculty of Health and Medicine Sciences, [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), and the [Douglas Research Centre](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/), QC, Canada. I completed my doctoral degree and Medical Psychological Institute of Central South University, and the Department of Psychiatry, McGill University. I received multidisciplinary training covering Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, Clinical Neuroscience, and Statistics, and had extensive research experiences. I have published more than 40 peer-reviewed papers and served as a peer reviewer for several high-impact journals in the field (e.g., *eBioMedicine*, *Depression and Anxiety*, *Psychological Medicine*).  In December 2025, I will join in Institute of Social Psychology, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://rwxy.xjtu.edu.cn/English.htm) (China) as an ***Assistant Professor*** (Tenure-track), where I will continue to develop my research programme.

My work centers around understanding the ***neurobiological mechanisms of mental disorders*** (especially for Major Depressive Disorder, Obessesive-Compulsive Disorder), exploring the roles of biological (neurodevelopments), psycho-socio environmental risk factors, and their interplay of these mental disorders across the life span. I am particularly dedicated to translating these findings into real-world clinical applications, aiming to advance early diagnosis, prevention, and precise and personalized treatement, with the goal of delivering the right intervention for the right person at the right time. Besides health analytics with clinical samples, I am also working on several population-based longitudinal cohort studies, with a primary focus on the impacts of ***adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)*** on individual psychological consequences and neurodevelopments.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, swiming, among many other things.

## *Call for Papers*

I am currently serving as guest editor of ***Psycho-Oncologie*** for a special issue, entitled "[***Psychological, Social, and Nursing Determinants of Cancer Outcomes: Integrative and Mechanistic Perspectives***](https://po.piscomed.com/index.php/PO/SI-11)". We welcome submissions of insightful articles from researchers in related fields！
