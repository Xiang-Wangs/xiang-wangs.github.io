Thanks for visiting my website!

I am a research fellow at Faculty of Health and Medicine Sciences, [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), and the [Douglas Research Centre](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/), QC, Canada. I completed my doctorate degree and Medical Psychological Institute of Central South University, and the Department of Psychiatry, McGill University. I received multidisciplinary training covering Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, Clinical Neuroscience, and Statistics, and had extensive research experiences. I have published more than 40 peer-reviewed papers and and served as a peer reviewer for several high-impact journals in the field (e.g., *Depression and Anxiety*, *Psychological Medicine*). 

My work centers around understanding the ***neurobiological mechanisms of mental disorders*** (especially for Major Depressive Disorder, Obessesive-Compulsive Disorder), exploring the roles of biological (neurodevelopments), psycho-socio environmental risk factors, and their interplay of these mental disorders across the life span. I am particularly dedicated to translating these findings into real-world clinical applications, aiming to advance early diagnosis, prevention, and precise and personalized treatement, with the goal of delivering the right intervention for the right person at the right time. Besides health analytics with clinical samples, I also work on several population-based longitudinal cohort studies, with a primary focus on the impact of ***adversed childhood experiences (ACEs)*** on individual psychological consequences and neurodevelopments.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, swiming, among many other things.
