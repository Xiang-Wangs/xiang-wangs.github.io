<strong>Summary</strong>
This special issue seeks to advance an integrative understanding of the psychological health of individuals living with cancer, and how psychological, social, and caregiving processes influence cancer trajectories, symptom burden, and recovery. We aim to highlight both directions of influence: the psychological challenges posed by the cancer experience, and the impact of psychological, social, and nursing factors on disease outcomes.

We particularly welcome research that goes beyond documenting the prevalence of distress to uncover the underlying mechanisms—emotional, cognitive, behavioral, neurobiological, as well as caregiving-related—that shape psychological adaptation across the cancer continuum. Submissions may address questions such as: Why do some patients maintain resilience while others experience persistent psychological symptoms? What roles do stress physiology, emotion regulation, cognitive processing, nursing support, and social relationships play in these variations? How do these processes, in turn, affect biological functioning, treatment adherence, or recovery?
 
We encourage interdisciplinary contributions that bridge psycho-oncology, behavioral medicine, clinical psychology, nursing science, and neuroscience. Studies employing cross-level methodologies (e.g., combining self-report, behavioral, and biomarkers), targeting specific populations (e.g., adolescents, older adults, underserved groups), or evaluating psychosocial interventions are particularly welcome. We also welcome contributions that examine the role of oncology nurses in delivering psychosocial support, facilitating emotional communication, and addressing patients' mental health needs (e.g., psychological counseling, survivorship care, and other nurse-led interventions) throughout the cancer journey, which can provide valuable insights into scalable and person-centered models of care.

Through this collection, we aim to foster a more mechanistic, person-centered, and interdisciplinary approach to cancer care.
