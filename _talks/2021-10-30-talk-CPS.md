Independent of MDD diagnosis, participants with CT indicated decreased spontaneous brain activity (ALFF) in the left inferior temporal gyrus. However, the effect of CT on altered FCs of the left ITG-precuneus are different in MDD group and HC group. The altered spontaneous activity of the left inferior temporal gyrus and its FC with the precuneus may play an important role in the mechanism of the effect of childhood trauma on depression.
