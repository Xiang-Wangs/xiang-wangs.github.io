Highlights
======
* MDD patients showed moderate deficit in global attention with the effect size of 0.59 (95 % CI: 0.45 to 0.74).
* Small to moderate deficits were observed in different sub-domains of attention except for selective attention.
* The effect of depression severity on attention deficits should be considered.
* Universal and standardized neuropsychological tests should be adopted for the assessment of attention performance in future.

Abstract
======
Attention deficits have been proven in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, a detailed characterization of attention deficits in MDD was unclear. The aim of current study was to explore the specific deficits of attention in different sub-domains of attention so as to produce an overall picture of contemporary research on this field. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published researches. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and review of references were searched up to October 2019. Studies using at least one objective measurement to assess attention performances of MDD patients were included. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models for attention outcomes. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test. Twenty-three eligible studies including 1371 MDD patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Significant deficit of global attention was observed. For the specific outcomes, MDD patients showed significant deficits in psychomotor speed/attention, auditory attention, visuo-spatial attention, sustained visual attention, ranging from small to moderate, but not in selective attention. Larger sample sizes and more detailed subgroup analyses based on features of patients should be conducted to produce a more accurate conclusion.
