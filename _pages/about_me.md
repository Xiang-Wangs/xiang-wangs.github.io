Thanks for visiting my website!

I am a research fellow at Faculty of Health and Medicine Sciences, [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), QC, Canada. I received multidisciplinary training covering sociology, psychology, psychiatry, clinical neuroscience, and statistics. I am particularly interested in examining the underlying neural mechanism of childhood maltreatment in later-on mental health and mental illness. I am currently focuses on unveiling the hetergeneity of MDD in terms of its etiology, pathomechanism.
